# Advanced-Public-Transportation-System-Software-Implementation

This repository contains the code for scalable implementation of the advanced urban public transportation system for the scenarios of developing countries where the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) infrastructure deployment is limited. 

## Documentation:
Please refer the following [link](https://pruthvishrajput.github.io/Advanced-Public-Transportation-System-Software-Implementation/) for the documentation of the proposed system.

## Dataset: 
The project dataset can be found in the given [link](https://doi.org/10.17632/39hjn56wkp.1) (Alternate [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ysoAymbBmF03MFmwlD9ul9z-ISxZDWU_?usp=sharing))

## Reproducible capsule (For execution in a single click)


This repository contains the code for scalable implementation of the advanced urban public transportation system for the scenarios of developing countries where the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) infrastructure deployment is limited. The software achieves scalability by executing the minimal task in real-time and remaining computation in an offline mode. 

## Execution of software
### Reproducible capsule
The reproducible capsule contains all the codes, dataset, and computation environment dependencies (or libraries) in a docker. It guarantees the reproducibility of the code. 

Click [here](https://codeocean.com/capsule/9953786/tree) to execute the reproducible capsule.

### Downloading the file on the local system.
The user can download/clone the source code repository in the local system to execute the APTS solution in their system. The user must download the following software (and libraries) before running the code.

#### List of required software (and libraries) for local system execution
1. Python3
2. MongoDB community server
3. Python libraries: astropy ≥ 5.1, folium ≥ 0.12.1.post1, ipywidgets ≥ 8.0.2, matplotlib ≥ 3.6.0, notebook ≥ 6.4.12, numpy ≥ 1.23.3, openpyxl ≥ 3.0.10, pandas ≥ 1.5.0, pymongo ≥ 4.2.0 (and xfs file system), scikit-learn ≥ 1.1.2, scipy ≥ 1.9.1, sklearn≥ 0.0

### Executing your own data records 

- The users can execute the APTS solutions using the project dataset. 
- Alternatively,  the users can use their own compatible datasets by placing them in the appropriate subfolder of `UserData` folder and selecting the variable `ProjectDataUsed` value as `False`. 
- The `UserData` folder can contain the empty folders `LocationRecords`, `TransportMode`, and `SitStandRecord` folders where the users can place their trip data with the above-mentioned record and file name format.
